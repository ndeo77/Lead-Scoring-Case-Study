# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
## Problem Statement and Objective
X Education, an online education company, aims to enhance its lead conversion process by implementing a logistic regression model. The company currently faces challenges with a low lead conversion rate despite attracting numerous professionals to its website through various marketing channels. To address this issue, the company wants to identify and prioritize potential leads, referred to as 'Hot Leads,' to improve the efficiency of its sales team.
The proposed logistic regression model will assign a lead score ranging from 0 to 100 to each potential lead. A higher score indicates a greater likelihood of conversion, while a lower score suggests a lower probability. By focusing on leads with higher scores, the sales team can optimize their efforts and increase the overall lead conversion rate.
The model will consider various factors such as browsing behavior, form submissions, and referrals to assess the potential of each lead. Through this predictive analysis, the company aims to allocate resources more effectively and target leads with a higher probability of conversion.
Additionally, the logistic regression model is designed to be adaptable to future changes and challenges faced by the company. The flexibility of the model allows it to adjust to evolving requirements and handle new problems that may arise in the lead conversion process.
The final deliverable will include a comprehensive presentation (PPT) that outlines the logistic regression model, its variables, and the methodology used to assign lead scores. Furthermore, the presentation will address specific problems presented by the company, as outlined in a separate document, and provide recommendations based on the insights gained from the model.
